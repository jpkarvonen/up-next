Up Next is an application I developed for the Take-Home Assignment portion of Bloc.io's final certification. The assignment is to create a TV show discovery web app utilizing the [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started).

My implementation of this application fulfills the following functional requirements:

1. When first loaded, there should be a list of popular TV shows and a search bar.
2. Upon searching for a TV show in the search bar, the user should see a list of shows whose title matches the search.
3. After clicking on a TV show, the user should be taken to a page with more information about that particular TV show.

My application also fulfills the following requirements:

1. Create a full-stack application with a backend that communicates with the movie API.
2. The front-end should be intuitive to use
3. Deploy your site to a web host (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Netlify, Google AppEngine, etc.).

I fulfilled the above requirements by:
1. (To be written upon application's completion.)
